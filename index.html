      <p>
        Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or
        disciplines which originated in ancient India and aim to control (yoke)
        and still the mind, recognizing a detached witness-consciousness
        untouched by the mind (Chitta) and mundane suffering (Du·∏•kha). There is
        a wide variety of schools of yoga, practices, and goals in Hinduism,
        Buddhism, and Jainism, and traditional and modern yoga is practiced
        worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two general theories exist on the origins of yoga. The linear model
        holds that yoga originated in the Vedic period, as reflected in the
        Vedic textual corpus, and influenced Buddhism; according to author
        Edward Fitzpatrick Crangle, this model is mainly supported by Hindu
        scholars. According to the synthesis model, yoga is a synthesis of
        non-Vedic and Vedic elements; this model is favoured in Western
        scholarship. Yoga is first mentioned in the Rigveda, and is referred to
        in a number of the Upanishads. The first known appearance of the word
        "yoga" with the same meaning as the modern term is in the Katha
        Upanishad, which was probably composed between the fifth and third
        centuries BCE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yoga continued to develop as a systematic study and practice during the
        fifth and sixth centuries BCE in ancient India's ascetic and ≈örama·πáa
        movements. The most comprehensive text on Yoga, the Yoga Sutras of
        Patanjali, date to the early centuries of the Common Era; Yoga
        philosophy became known as one of the six orthodox philosophical schools
        (Dar≈õanas) of Hinduism in the second half of the first millennium CE.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hatha yoga texts began to emerge between the ninth and 11th centuries,
        originating in tantra. The term "yoga" in the Western world often
        denotes a modern form of Hatha yoga and a posture-based physical
        fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique, consisting largely of
        the asanas;this differs from traditional yoga, which focuses on
        meditation and release from worldly attachments.It was introduced by
        gurus from India after the success of Swami Vivekananda's adaptation of
        yoga without asanas in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
        Vivekananda introduced the Yoga Sutras to the West, and they became
        prominent after the 20th-century success of hatha yoga.
